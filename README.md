# Very Simple Ionic Getting Started Project
This is a lucky draw demo app.  Tapping at the button, it generates a lucky number between 1 to 100

Once downloaded and unzipped, change directory to the project, and run
`npm install`


Followed by
`ionic serve`
to run on development server (Make sure you've installed Node.js, Cordova and Ionic).
